# C++ Learning Journey

I’m currently learning C++ by completing the **Beginning C++ Programming – From Beginner to Beyond** course on Udemy. This course teaches modern C++ basics and builds up to more advanced concepts so I can write real C++ programs and understand how the language works from the ground up.

## 📘 What I’m Learning

This course covers core C++ programming fundamentals such as:

- Variables, data types, and operators  
- Conditional logic and loops  
- Functions and scope  
- Working with arrays and `vector` containers  
- Pointers and memory management  
- Object-oriented C++ (classes, objects, inheritance)  
- Standard Template Library (STL) basics  
- More advanced topics like constructors, destructors, and smart pointers  
*(topics commonly taught in C++ beginner courses)* :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🎯 My Goals

I’m learning C++ so I can:

- Build strong **programming fundamentals** that transfer to other languages  
- Understand **how memory, references, and pointers work**  
- Write structured and efficient C++ code  
- Prepare for bigger projects and possibly a programming job in the future

## 🧠 What I’ve Practiced

So far, I’ve worked on:

- Loop logic and array/vector iteration  
- Writing functions to solve problems  
- Understanding references vs pointers  
- Simple projects and coding challenges  
- Debugging syntax and logic errors  

Each exercise helps reinforce concepts learned in the course.

## 🛠️ Tools I Use

- **C++ Compiler:** (e.g., `g++`, MSVC, Clang)  
- **IDE/Editor:** (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio)  
- **Udemy Course Content:** video lessons, quizzes, and coding tasks
